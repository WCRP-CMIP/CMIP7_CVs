                > * AER  : Aerosol treatment in an atmospheric model where concentrations are calculated based on emissions, transformation, and removal processes (rather than being prescribed or omitted entirely)
                > * AGCM : Atmospheric general circulation model run with prescribed ocean surface conditions and usually a model of the land surface
                > * AOGCM : Coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate model, additionally including explicit representation of at least the land and sea ice
                > * BGC  : Biogeochemistry model component that at the very least accounts for carbon reservoirs and fluxes in the atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere, and ocean
                > * CHEM : Chemistry treatment in an atmospheric model that calculates atmospheric oxidant concentrations (including at least ozone), rather than prescribing them
                > * ISM  : Ice-sheet model that includes ice-flow
                > * LAND : Land model run uncoupled from the atmosphere
                > * OGCM : Ocean general circulation model run uncoupled from an AGCM but, usually including a sea-ice model
                > * RAD  : Radiation component of an atmospheric model run 'offline'
                > * SLAB : Slab-ocean used with an AGCM in representing the atmosphere-ocean coupled system

        description: |
            For experiments initialized on a particular historical date, enter
            that date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. 
            
                If a set of sub-experiments are
                initialized at different times, list all the start times requested.
            
                - For example, for an historical simulation initialized at the beginning of
                1850, enter “1850-01-01”. 
                - For a set of DCPP “prediction” runs, enter all
                dates of the first full forecast/hindcast year (e.g., 1960, 1970, 1980,
                1990, 2000, 2010).

                field blank

        For experiments initialized from a non-arbitrary point in a parent
        experiment, enter the branch date in the parent,i.e. the point at which
        initial conditions should be taken. 
            
            - For example, “2022-01-01” should be
            entered for an experiment initialized from the end of the historical
            experiment and extending into the future. 
            - If there is no parent
            experiment please leave this field blank.

              Calculation : (end_year - start_year + 1)
              - For example, “172” would be specified for a run initialized
              in 1850-01-01 and extending to 2022-01-01.
